# Color-By-Number
Color-By-Number is a program that utilizes Dr. James Plank's graphing utility jgraph to convert images into color-by-number games.

## Using Color-By-Number
After cloning this repository, simply type "make" to compile the program. The executable in /bin/ should already be current, but do it just to make sure.
Running "make clean" will remove the executable and all object files.
Make will also run the program on all of the images in the /example/ directory, outputting each image's color-by-number in /example/pdfs.
